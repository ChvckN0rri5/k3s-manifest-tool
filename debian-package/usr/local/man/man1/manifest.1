NAME
       manifest - manage K3s manifest files

SYNOPSIS
       manifest [edit [filename] | <filename> | --refresh-cache | -c | --config]

DESCRIPTION
       The manifest script manages files in the K3s manifest directory, specified by K3S_MANIFEST_PATH in /etc/manifest.env (typically /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests/). It can move a file to the manifest directory, retaining its original filename, or edit existing files in the directory using sudo nano. The script requires sudo privileges for operations in the manifest directory and maintains a cache of the directory's contents for autocompletion.

       When invoked with a filename, the script moves the file to the manifest directory, keeping its original name. If a file with the same name already exists, the user is prompted to edit it or rename the source file.

       When invoked with the "edit" subcommand, the script allows the user to select a file from the manifest directory to edit using nano. If a filename is provided after "edit", that specific file is edited.

       The --refresh-cache option updates the cache of the manifest directory's contents, stored in /tmp/manifest_files_cache.
